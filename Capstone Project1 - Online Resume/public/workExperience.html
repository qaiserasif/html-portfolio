    <h3>April 2017 till Present</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Lead the hardware design and development of a Multi-Board Embedded Computer System (MBECS) for challenging environment. Involved in all phases of design and development, from parts selection and library creation, Schematics Design, PCB Design, Circuit and PCB analysis, hardware functional testing (individual and integrated both), qualification testing, integrated testing, and environmental testing (EMI/EMC, vibration, shock, thermal vacuum). </li>
        <li>Managed change management for finalization of MBECS and ensured Design for Manufacturing (DFM) readiness.</li>
        <li>Prepared and finalized test plans for individual modules, which includes Power Module, Fault-Mitigation Module, Processing Module, Analog and Digital I/O and DAQ module, and the complete MBECS.</li>
        <li>Ensured the quality and reliability of the engineering system by performing FMEA, reliability analysis, and parts stress analysis, worst case scenario analysis, SEU and SEL analysis and many more.</li>
        <li>Prepared and managed Bill of Materials for all components and materials to be used in all project levels.</li>
        <li>Designed and developed the hardware for sensor and actuator emulator cards for Electrical Support Equipment for electrical testing and validation of MBECS.</li>
        <li>Reviewed PCB layouts of all the other digital systems of the entire system to ensure they are DFM ready.</li>
    </ul>
